This was my first attempt at anything other than teddies. A friend of mine is getting married soon and I wanted to make something for her as part of her gift. After deciding that I'm not quite ready for a blanket yet, I opted to make some coasters. I used this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ium6UBEEpm0">tutorial</a> from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/sa8rah56">Bella Coco's YouTube channel</a>.

I tried a number of colour variations as shown below. (From right to left: Ricorumi DK in Light Grey; Silver Grey; Light Blue; Vanilla; and some leftover pink yarn - brand unknown)

In the end I opted for the Silver Grey. I have made four coasters in the Silver Grey and have since started matching placemats. The coasters themselves are very quick to make. A great way to spend an evening...
