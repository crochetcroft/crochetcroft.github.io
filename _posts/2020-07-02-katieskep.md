This was my first attempt at fair isle knitting and it really was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I had some difficulty at the beginning figuring out the two colour rib (you can't just keep your purling colour to the front!) but other than that it was pretty straight forward.
I used the Katie's Kep pattern - designed by Wilma Malcolmson for this year's Shetland Wool Week festival, due to be held in September 2020 but cancelled due to COVID-19, of course. The pattern can be downloaded for free at https://www.shetlandwoolweek.com/free-knitting-pattern/ The pattern is easy to follow if you are a beginner, and there is even a Katie's Kep knit-along Facebook group if you get stuck: https://www.facebook.com/groups/swwkal/ (I only discovered the group after I finished knitting my hat!)
I used Jamieson's & Smith 2ply jumper weight yarn, as per the pattern instructions (yarn purchased from https://www.shetlandwoolbrokers.co.uk/)

I love how the hat turned out and think the colours look great!
