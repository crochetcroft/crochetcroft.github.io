This was my first attempt at fair isle knitting and it really was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I had some difficulty at the beginning figuring out the two colour rib (you can't just keep your purling colour to the front!) but other than that it was pretty straightforward.
<br>
<br>
I used the Katie's Kep pattern - designed by Wilma Malcolmson for this year's Shetland Wool Week festival, due to be held in September 2020 but cancelled due to COVID-19, of course. The pattern can be downloaded for free <a href="https://www.shetlandwoolweek.com/free-knitting-pattern/">here</a>. The pattern is easy to follow if you are a beginner, and there is even a Katie's Kep <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/swwkal/">knit-along Facebook group</a> if you get stuck (I only discovered the group after I finished knitting my hat!)
<br>
<br>
I used Jamieson's & Smith 2ply jumper weight yarn, as per the pattern instructions (yarn purchased from <a href="https://www.shetlandwoolbrokers.co.uk/"the Shetland Woolbrokers website</a>).

I love how the hat turned out and think the colours look great!
