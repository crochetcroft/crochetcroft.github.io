This was my first project using the <a href="https://www.edwardscrochet.com/Article_Pages_imaginarium.aspx" target="_blank">Edward's Crochet Imaginarium</a> book. If you are not familiar with the book, there are instructions for body parts (ears, arms, legs) in various styles, which you can mix and match to create all sorts of monsters. I used the following instructions: "H:4" for the ears, "A:1" for the arms, and "F:1" for the legs.

<br>
In terms of the colouring and pattern, I used a light grey DK yarn (Ricorumi DK in Silver Grey) for the head and half of the body. For the bottom of the body and the tops of the legs I used some leftover dark grey yarn (brand unknown). The tops of the arms and the bottoms of the legs were done in black DK yarn (Ricorumi DK in Black). Then I followed instructions to make a stripy pattern for the bottom of the arms, the hands, and the feet. Here I used the Black Ricorumi DK, Ricorumi DK in White, and some leftover teal yarn (brand unknown). The teal yarn was also used for the ears.
<br>
Other details: eyes were sewn on following instructions in the book and using the Ricorumi White and Black DK, and about two thirds of the way down the head I switched from the Ricorumi Silver Grey to White for one round to give the appearance of a mouth (or teeth).
