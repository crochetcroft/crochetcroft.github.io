I managed to build* this site with zero previous HTML/ web developer experience thanks to some very helpful online guides. As such, I can't really tell you how I made this website... I can, however, tell you that I had inspiration from [Jan Freyberg's website](http://www.janfreyberg.com/), I used this [template](https://github.com/volny/stylish-portfolio-jekyll), I consulted these [instructions](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), and that there was a <strong>lot</strong> of trial and error. If you would like some more detailed instructions about building a website using github pages, take a look at this [blog post](http://www.janfreyberg.com/blog/2016-11-20-how-i-built-this/) from Jan Freyberg's website.

If you are a seasoned web developer I'm sure the [code](https://github.com/kapeters/kapeters.github.io) behind this site will fill you with rage. But hey! It works!

*more like <i>customise</i> since I did not build this from scratch - although I would like to give that a go some time!
