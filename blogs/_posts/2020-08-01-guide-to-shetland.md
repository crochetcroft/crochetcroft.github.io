A friend of mine just visited Shetland for the first time (July 2020) and, prior to his trip, had asked me for some recommendations for things to do (beyond the more traditional touristy activities). I ended up compiling a pretty detailed document of activities so I thought I would post the list here for others to enjoy/ marvel at/ criticise.
<br>
Some caveats:
* This is by no means a comprehensive guide of things to do in Shetland, since there is already a wealth of information on sites like <a href="https://www.shetland.org/" target="_blank">shetland.org</a> and <a href="https://www.shetlandvisitor.com/" target="_blank">shetlandvisitor.com</a>. Rather, I have listed some things that I love to do when I go home, and which might not be the most well known activities. (In saying that, I do also list things like St Ninian's Isle because I didn't want to give the impression that my other list items are recommended over the classic spots!)
* This guide was written with (i) summer activities in mind, so doesn't cover things like the Up Helly Aa festivals which happen in winter,and (ii) with the ongiong COVID-19 pandemic. It is obviously difficult to say how long the current situation will affect the activities on this list but do check <a href="https://www.shetland.org/" target="_blank">shetland.org</a> for updates and guidance on visiting Shetland.

<h1>Easy walks in Lerwick</h1>
Starting in Lerwick, here are some of my favourite walks. All are relatively quick and easy.
<br>
1. The Knab/ Lodberries
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/img/map.jpg" class="responsive"></div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="theknab.jpg" alt="TheKnab" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="Lodberries.jpg" alt="Lodberries" style="width:100%">
  </div>
</div>
Starting either at Commercial Street or the coastal path near Clickimin Road. If starting at the coastal path, pass the Lerwick Hotel and onto Breiwick Road. At Ronald Street, take the coastal path along The Knab and follow it behind Lerwick cemetery, then Twageos Road passing the Lodberries “Jimmy Perez’s house” and continue onto Commercial St, “Da Street”.
<br>
2. Clickimin Broch
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/img/map.jpg" class="responsive"></div>
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/img/broch.jpg" class="responsive"></div>
Take the path around Clickimin Loch and visit Clickimin Broch (Picts Castle), which is free to enter (although possibly not open to visitors at the moment).
<br>
3. Sands of Sound beach
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/img/map.jpg" class="responsive"></div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="sandsofsound1.jpg" alt="TheKnab" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="sandsofsound2.jpg" alt="Lodberries" style="width:100%">
  </div>
</div>
Walk via Sea Road (next to Tesco) for views of Bressay. Turn up Seafield Road and onto Nedersund Road. Turn right at the fork and continue to the beach.
<br>
4. Sea Road
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/img/map.jpg" class="responsive"></div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="searoad1.jpg" alt="TheKnab" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="searoad2.jpg" alt="Lodberries" style="width:100%">
  </div>
</div>
Carry on down Sea Road as far as you can go (up the hill and past the farm). Cows and views of Sands of Sound on one side and Bressay on the other.
<br>
5. Staney Hill
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/img/map.jpg" class="responsive"></div>
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/img/staneyhill.jpg" class="responsive"></div>
Full views of Lerwick. I have probably not drawn the route very accurately here. Go round the right side of the Anderson High School, up Staney Hill Road. You can turn left off the path once you get to the bench (maybe just before the bench?) You can walk round to a stone wall. You can continue on up the hill behind but it is sometimes boggy. Staying at the wall is good enough for views.
<br>
<h1>Advanced walks/hikes</h1>
* In Lerwick
1. Ward of Bressay
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/img/map.jpg" class="responsive"></div>
Technically not Lerwick but close enough. Bressay is a 10 minute ferry ride from Lerwick. You can hike up the Ward of Bressay. I have never done it but it is supposed to be great for views on a clear day: “all the way across to Foula on the west side, to the white orb of Unst’s Saxa Vord radar station in the north, and south beyond Sumburgh Head all the way to Fair Isle”. It is 2.8 miles each way (from the Bressay Ferry terminal). It is an old road so recommended as a walk rather than a drive.
* Further afield
A list of advanced walks can be found <a href="https://www.shetland.org/things/outdoor/walking" target="_blank">here</a>.
My friend, Kirsten, especially recommends:
* <a href="https://www.shetland.org/things/outdoor/walking/fethaland-circular" target="_blank">Fethaland</a> (circular walk to an old fishing village) and
* <a href="https://www.shetland.org/things/outdoor/walking/eshaness-circular" target="_blank">Eshaness</a> (circular walk passing Eshaness cliffs)
in the north. And:
* <a href="https://www.shetland.org/things/outdoor/walking/st-ninians-isle-circular" target="_blank">St Ninian's Isle circular</a> (circular walk starting at the sand tombolo)
in the south.

* Further afield
1. See some Shetland ponies
Shetland ponies are found in various places but should be at the following locations: next to the Scalloway Museum, next to Spiggie Hotel, and there *should be* Shetland ponies at the roadside on the first road after the quarry and before you reach Scalloway (see figure below). In 2019, when I went in June, there were foals here.

2. Puffins
Sumburgh head is good for Puffin spotting. Puffins are usually in Shetland from (.....)
3. The Outpost
A wooden portkabin transformed into a bar by an Australian expat. There are also goats, pigs, wallabies. I think there were baby emus when I went last year. Opening times are posted on <a href="" target="_blank">Facebook</a>
