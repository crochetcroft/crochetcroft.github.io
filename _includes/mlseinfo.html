      <p class="text-justify">The MLSE study is an MRC-funded, multi-centre project which aims to develop a clinical test for the assessment and monitoring of progressive aphasic syndromes: The Mini Linguistic State Examination (MLSE). The study is led by St Georgeâ€™s, University of London, in conjunction with researchers at the University of Cambridge, the University of Manchester, and the Istituto Universitario di Studi Superiori di Pavia, Italy. The MLSE is also being adapted for use in other languages/ cultures.

      <p class="text-justify">I am a research associate for the Cambridge arm of the MLSE study. We are currently recruiting patients with primary progressive aphasia to take part in the MLSE study in Cambridge, London, and Manchester. We are also recruiting patients with other types of dementia, and patients with post-stroke aphasia. We aim to begin publishing various papers resulting from the MLSE study in the coming months. I will update this page with my first-authored posters and papers relating to this project.</p>
